# About W3UP Domains

[W3 Name Service](https://w3up.cc/) (W3NS) Protocol is a distributed, open, and scalable naming system based on EVM blockchain.

### Why would anyone need a web3 domain name?

**Your crypto address is hard to remember**: 

It starts with `0x`, but then continues with 40 random characters (digits from `0` to `9` and letters from `a` to `f`).

If you want someone to send you tokens, sure you could send them your address and they could copy-paste it into their wallet. But wouldn't it be great if they could just enter a domain name, like `john.w3`, instead of the whole address?

âžœ This is what they will can do on [w3up.cc](https://w3up.cc). (To stay informed, follow the [roadmap](./roadmap.md).)

**Web3 dApps, games and social networks integrations**:

Another usecase is to have a domain name as your username in various web3 dApps, games and upcoming social networks. 

âžœ Instead of your username being `0x542â€¦79a`, it could be simply `john.w3`.

**Show your participation in a DAO, NFT community or DEFI protocol**:

We offer the possibility for DAOs & NFT communities to create their own name service in partnership with W3UP.

So let's imagine, the **XYZcash DEFI protocol** launches its `TLD` with our technology: 

âžœ Users will be able to get their ```.xyzcash``` usernames and show their participation in this protocol.

For more information: [Domains for DAO's](./dao-nft.md)

If you're a member of a DAO and would be interested in having your own ```TLD```, don't hesitate to reach out to us via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/W3UPcc).

### But isn't all that already done by ENS?

âžœ Yes, but they only do it on ***Ethereum L1*** and only with `.eth`. 

**W3UP Domains** allows many different top-level domains (TLDs), on **any EVM blockchain** such as `.w3`,`.bnb`, `.dao`, etc. 

**W3UP Domains enables anyone to create a TLD, operate it and earn revenue from it:**

âžœ For example, a DeFi protocol like Aave could create a TLD named `.aave`, and the revenue from each domain purchase would go to Aave treasury.

**W3UP Domains architecture is very flexible and it allows for various domain business models:**

The first one is a one-time domain purchase (no renewals), but new ones will be added in the future (like time-restricted domain ownership,...). To stay informed, follow the [roadmap](./roadmap.md).

### Not only domains!

**W3UP Domains** is not just about domains (in the web2 sense of the word). 

âžœ It's about **identity** in the web3 world. ðŸ†”

Domain name gives you a ***digital identity***, and ***data*** attached to this identity strengthen it.

Another thing that **W3UP Domains** values is ***total decentralization***.  

Our contracts are ***non-upgradable*** (no proxy) and ***do not need any keepers*** (or similar external software) to function properly.
