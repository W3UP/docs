# TLDs for DAOs

Each top-level domain (like ```.w3```) in the [W3UP](https://w3up.cc) protocol can be owned by a different entity. 

âžœ This makes it perfect for DAOs and NFTs communities.

#### **[W3UP](https://w3up.cc/) offer the possibility for DAOs & NFT communities to create their own name service**:

So let's imagine, the **XYZcash DEFI protocol** launches its `TLD` with our technology: 

âžœ Users will be able to get their ```.xyzcash``` usernames and show their participation in this protocol.

### 1. Ownership

Let's take our example above ***XYZcashDAO*** whose community members are very active and enthusiastic. ðŸ‘‡

***XYZcashDAO*** decides to create a top-level domain (TLD) with the W3UP protocol called `.xyzcash`.

Members can mint domain names (or usernames) such as `john.xyzcash`, `phil.bestdao`, `charon.bestdao`, etc. which increases their sense of belonging to the common cause.

### 2. Income for the DAO treasury

This also gives the DAO Treasury a **new source of revenue**. 

âžœ The revenue from domain registration goes **directly** to the DAO treasury.

### 3. Getting the word out about your DAO

Finally, having your own `TLD` is a great **marketing** tool for reaching people outside your community. 

Members of your DAO can use their domain name as a **username** on platforms like **Twitter** and thus **increase awareness** of your DAO - in the same way that `.eth` helped increase awareness of Ethereum outside the crypto space.
